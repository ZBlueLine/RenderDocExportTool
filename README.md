# RenderDocExportTool
Renderdoc model texture export script

Script *RenderDocDataParserForUnity.cs* modified based on [RenderDocMeshParserForUnity](github.com/windsmoon/RenderDocMeshParserForUnity). Use it in the menu Windsmoon -> Tools after putting it in unity


These two scripts run normally on RenderDoc 1.29 and Unity2021.3.15f, and other versions have not been tested.
